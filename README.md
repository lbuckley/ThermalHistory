# How damage and repair across thermal history alter the fitness impacts of thermal stress

Analysis of how thermal history influences performance

## Synopsis
Integrating estimates of organismsâ€™ thermal sensitivity of performance across time series of body temperatures is a common strategy for estimating the fitness implications of climate variability and change. The approach is an important first step in accounting for organismal sensitivity when estimating climate responses, but the approach omits the influence of past exposure to thermal stress. We fit data from experiments exposing aphids to stressful, fluctuating temperatures to a function accounting for thermal history to estimate rates of damage, repair, and carryover effects in response to thermal stress. Our analysis indicates that thermal stress and damage initiate at temperatures beyond thermal optima and considerably below critical thermal limits; that thermal stress can accumulate multiplicatively with the magnitude and duration of exposure; and that considerable and rapid rates of recovery and repair are possible but that rates decline quickly as temperatures diverge from the thermal optima. Accounting for damage and repair across thermal history is important to accurately assessing the fitness outcomes of climate change and variability.
